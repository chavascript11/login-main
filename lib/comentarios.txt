Flutter Framework Proficiency: During the development of the Multiform Android APP activity, 
I had to become proficient in the Flutter framework. This involved learning about Flutter's widgets, 
its layout system, and how to manage app state effectively.

Dart Programming Language: I also had to get familiar with the Dart programming language since 
Flutter is based on Dart. Understanding Dart's syntax, libraries, and best practices was crucial 
for the app's development.

Cross-Platform Development: One of the key takeaways from this project was the advantage of 
cross-platform development using Flutter. It allowed me to write code once and deploy it on both 
Android and iOS, which was a significant time and effort saver.

UI/UX Design with Flutter: Designing a user-friendly and visually appealing interface was an 
essential part of this project. I learned how to use Flutter's UI components effectively and create 
responsive and attractive user interfaces.

Package Management and Plugins: Flutter relies on packages and plugins to extend functionality. 
During this activity, I gained experience in managing dependencies and integrating third-party 
packages to add features and functionality to my app.
